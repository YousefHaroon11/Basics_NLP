El Clásico (in Spanish, also in lowercase letters;Spanish pronunciation: [el ˈklasiko]) or El Clàssic 
(in Catalan, pronounced [əl ˈklasik]), both meaning "The Classic", is the name given to any football match between rival clubs Barcelona
and Real Madrid. Originally referring to competitions held in the Spanish championship, the term now includes every match between the clubs
, such as those in the UEFA Champions League, Copa del Rey, and Supercopa de España. It is considered one of sport's fiercest rivalries, 
and its matches have a global audience of hundreds of millions.[3][4][5][6] A fixture known for its intensity,
 it has featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mockery from both sides.
